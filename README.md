## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need a Google Gemini API key.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**:

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-ai.git
    cd hangman-ai
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment variable:**
    This project is configured to use an API key from the environment. The method for setting this depends on your hosting provider. For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

    ```
    // .env
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    *Note: The current setup in `index.html` does not use a build tool to inject this variable. You will need a simple server or build process that can make this environment variable available to the browser.*

### Running the Application

This is a static web application. You can serve the `index.html` file using any simple web server. A great tool for this is `serve`.

1.  **Install `serve` globally (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```

2.  **Run the server from the project root:**
    ```bash
    serve .
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by `serve` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
